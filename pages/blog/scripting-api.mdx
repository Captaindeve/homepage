### Conversion

To build this for open.mp, we need to change just the first include and add one define.

This:

```pawn
#include <a_samp>

main() {}
```

Becomes:

```pawn
#define OPENMP_COMPAT
#include <openmp\openmp>

main() {}
```

The first error you might get is:

```
open.mp scripts require the community compiler from: git.io/pawn-compiler
```
