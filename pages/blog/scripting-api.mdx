# open.mp scripting

## Introduction

Firstly, a VERY important clarification - existing scripts will still work as-is.  We have worked
very hard on backwards compatibility and bear it in mind for every decision.  There are many
improvements we'd like to make that we simply can't for this reason, and other code that is greatly
complicated by this compatibility requirement.

That said, there are improvements that can be made all over the place.  Let's look at some examples
of the inconsistencies in SA:MP scripting:

### Tags

* `Menu:CreateMenu` - Tagged.
* `DB:db_open` - Tagged.
* `CreateVehicle` - Untagged.
* `CreateActor` - Untagged.

```pawn
#define SELECT_OBJECT_GLOBAL_OBJECT 1
#define SELECT_OBJECT_PLAYER_OBJECT 2

forward OnPlayerSelectObject(playerid, type, objectid, modelid, Float:fX, Float:fY, Float:fZ);
```

`type` is untagged, as are ALL SA:MP defined constants; unlike pawn default constants:

```pawn
native File:fopen(const name[], filemode:mode = io_readwrite);
```

### Naming

* `SetVehiclePos` - "Vehicle" in the middle of the function name.
* `TextDrawTextSize` - "TextDraw" at the start.
* `db_open` - "db" at the start and lower-case.
* `fread` - "file" at the start, and shortened.
* `asin` - A SA:MP added function without camel/pascal case.

* Consistency:

`GetVehicleZAngle` - "Z-Angle"
`GetVehicleRotationQuat` - "Rotation"
`SetPlayerFacingAngle` - "Facing Angle"
`SetObjectRot` - "Rot"

And despite all this, most libraries have now settled on the `Module_Method` naming convention.
